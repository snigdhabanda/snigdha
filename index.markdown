<p>I am a software engineer in New York. I work on distributed systems and applied AI.</p>

<p> I most recently spent a few months at South Park Commons running experiments with LLMs to build a second brain for physicians and researchers at academic hospitals. I worked 0-1 on designing product, writing code, and establishing customer partnerships.</p>

<p>I previously worked on the developer velocity team at Square/Cash App for 2 years. I made systems more stable, helped scale the app through internationalization, and architected new developer services.</p>

<p>I also had a stint at a seed-stage conversational AI startup.</p>

<p>I studied computational neuroscience at Rice University, researched the impact of attention on cortical processing, and was accepted to medical school.</p>
